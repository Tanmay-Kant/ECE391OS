Bug: Error stating ./debug.sh when trying to sudo make from wfh setup

Fix: By running the commands: dos2unix debug.sh and chmod +x debug.sh, the format is converted to UNIX format which fixes the error


Bug: no such instruction found when writing the assembly linkage macro for the exceptions

Fix: By fixing the header files included as well as the ordering of the variables defined similar to the ece391syscall.S file given to us, the error was fixed.



Bug: We kept on receiving a General Protection Fault when initializing the IDT.

Fix: We had to modify the present bit to ensure that the present bit of only the first 20 exceptions, the keyboard and rtc interrupt, and the system call are set to 1 while the remaining IDT entries have their present bit set to 0.

Bug: Bounds error boot loop 

Fix: there was an issue with our initialization of the gdt and we did not pass a pointer to gdt desc to load it in so we had stack corruption errors so we had to redo the gdt initalization with it

Bug: Only our asm volatile test case was working 

Fix: There was an error with how we called the exception handler in our linkage assembly file we re wrote a case for exception errors, errors and for interrupt handling this made us rework how we called the prints and implicitly fixed the problem
